# The Beads Project

This is the Beads project, a Java library for creative realtime audio and music, which is also available as a library for Processing.

Written by Ollie Bown, with contributions from Ben Porter, Benito, Aengus Martin, Neil Smith, Evan Merz and Angelo Fraietta. It also uses some code from other Java projects including MEAP and JASS. For convenience it wraps Java dependencies Tritonus, JavaZOOM and mp3spi.

The library is licensed under the Gnu Public License (GPL v3). Contact ollie at icarus.nu if you have any questions.
